# Data Analytics Portfolio

### By Wes Chorney

Here is a collection of my data analytics projects. This portfolio will be updated regularly whenever I make something new that I want to share.

## SQL Deforestation Project

In this project, I used SQL and Python to investigate how deforestation affected certain areas. My main findings were that the United States and England had a lot of deforestation relative to their population size. Here is [the link to the repository](https://github.com/wes-at-masterschool/sql-deforestation-project). 

In my Python work, I used the libraries `pandas`, `random`, `itertools`, and `functools`. 

I used correlated subqueries and CTEs in SQL.

## Job Board Project

In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and SQL to imitate a job board (not really). Here is the final product:
